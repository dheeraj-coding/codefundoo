				<h2>What it does</h2>
				<p> Torrid makes it easy to get smart updates and assistance before and during heatwaves </p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-android"></span>
						<h3>Built on Android</h3>
						<p> Supporting android, the most popular mobile OS platform in existence, ensures more people can benefit out of
							the service and keep themselves safe </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-lock"></span>
						<h3>Built with privacy in mind</h3>
						<p> Background services and smart tracking features are fully user configurable, which means Torrid only uses
							data you are willing to provide</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-bar-chart"></span>
						<h3>Smart predictions, simple interface</h3>
						<p> The Torrid server monitors weather data and predicts the possibility of a heatwave in the next few days.
							Torrid presents this in a simple, intuitive interface, so you don't have to be a tech guru to benefit from
							Torrid.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
						<h3>Hospital Dashboard</h3>
						<p> The Torrid hospital dashboard helps hospitals identify torrid users in distress during a heatwave and better
							allocate resoures to help save more lives </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-heartbeat"></span>
						<h3>Live heart rate tracking</h3>
						<p> Torrid can monitor the heart rate provided by a fitness tracker in real time and notify the user of signs of
							heat strokes, heart attacks and general heat stress during a heatwave </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-battery-3"></span>
						<h3>Efficient on the network and on the battery</h3>
						<p> The Torrid android app is designed to work with the battery management features of Android, so Torrid won't
							make you run in search of a phone charger. </br> Torrid also uses very little data, so it should work
							efficiently on metered and slow network connections </p>

				<h2>Why heatwaves?</h2>
				<h3>Because heatwaves are deadly. More deadly than you think. </h3>
				<p></p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-users"></span>
						<h3>Death toll</h3>
						<p> Heatwaves often have a death toll in the thousands. The Indian heatwave in 2015 killed over 2500 people and
							the 2018 Japan heatwave resulted in the hospitalization of 22,000 people and the death of almost 80 </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-globe"></span>
						<h3>Global warming and Climate change</h3>
						<p> Heatwaves are only going to become more common due the effects of global warming and climate change. The
							frequency of deadly heatwaves is expected to increase not only in the tropics, but all over the world. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-book"></span>
						<h3>Lack of awareness</h3>
						<p> Heatwaves are silent killers. One of the reason they are so deadly is because people are less likely to take
							abnormally hot weather seriously. Hence, this needs to be addressed by highlighting the dangers of heatwaves </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-heartbeat"></span>
						<h3>Widespread effects</h3>
						<p> The effects of heatwaves can span across multiple districts or states. Deadly heatwaves are not only limited
							to the tropics, but can occur in colder climates as well</p>
