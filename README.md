PROJECT IDEA

Due to the effects of climate change, heat waves have started to become increasingly more frequent. They are also hard to predict. As a natural disaster, heat waves do not come up in the media very often, but they usually have a very high casualty rate. Our project hopes to improve early detection/localization of heat waves and also help those in the thick of it.

The National Disaster Management Authority of India defines a heat wave as a period of abnormally hot weather, where the temperature exceeds the typical maximum temperature observed in that region in the summer. The adverse effects of heat waves are caused due to a combination of high humidity and an abnormally high temperature.

Therefore our project will track temperature and humidity over a period of time and try to predict the possibility of a heatwave occuring in the near future. Users with a smartphone app installed on their devices can then subscribe to timely warnings from our prediction service, and also get guidance to keep themselves safe.

Additionally, our project will also use smart watches and fitness trackers that can monitor parameters like heart rate to monitor groups of people and their heartrates in a region and use their heartrate to determine if they are showing symptoms of heatstroke and other heat wave related abnormalities. If a large group of people show similar signs, alerts that there is a heat wave will be sent out to all in the region (whether or not they have a fitness tracker). The alerts can optionally be targeted to users belonging a similar demographic as the users with fitness trackers showing signs of heat wave related abnormalities.

Alot of the times, people call for help too late as they themselves don't realize the stress their body is going through during a heat wave. The app will send notification of the location of the individual and his life signs to nearby hospitals should he be showing any signs of heat related problems.

We can also use the app to collect usefuls statistics over time, and maybe extend it's features to other disasters.
