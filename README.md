PROJECT IDEA

Heat waves can strike a place at any time, and people are often ill prepared for it. THey are also hard to predict. As a natural disaster, heat waves do not come up in the media very often, but they usually have a very high casualty rate. Our project hopes to improve early detection/localization of heat waves and also help those in the thick of it.

Our project will involve smart watches that can monitor things like heart rate. Using machine learning methods, we will monitor groups of people and their heartrates in a region and use heartrate to determine if they are showing symptoms of heatstroke and other heat wave related abnormalities. If a large group of people show similar signs, alerts that there is a heat wave will be sent out to all in the region. Alot of the times, people call for help too late as they themselves don't realize the stress their body is going through during a heat wave. The app will send notification of the location of the individual and his life signs to nearby hospitals should he be showing any signs of heat related problems.

We can also use the app to collect usefuls statistics over time, and maybe extend it's features to other disasters.
